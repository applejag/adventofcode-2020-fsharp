# Advent of Code 2020 via F#

This repo contains my attempt at Advent of Code 2020
(<https://adventofcode.com/2020>).

## Running it

- Install .NET 5.0

- Run with the `dotnet` CLI inside the project you wish to run.
  For day 1, you would run:

  ```sh
  $ cd src/Day01

  # To run it on "input.txt" in current directory
  $ dotnet run

  # To run it on some other file, example:
  $ dotnet run -- sample.txt
  ```
